# maven-shade-sbom

This is a testcase/example Maven project using the [maven-shade-plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/)
and showing how this is currently (not) embedded into the SBOMs
generated by the various SBOM generation plugins.

## Desired encoding

AFAICT it is not clear how this information _should_ be represented in the
various SBOM formats: notably, how to distinguish between 'regular'
dependencies of the library and shaded code.

## Use

When building a final SBOM for a project using this library, 'regular'
dependencies will be visible (and can have been overridden) to the
project, so the 'regular' dependencies from the SBOM from the library
can be ignored. However, the shaded dependencies are not visible in the
dependency tree, so they need to be taken from the published SBOM.
