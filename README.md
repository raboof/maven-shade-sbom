# maven-shade-sbom

This is a testcase/example Maven project using the [maven-shade-plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/)
and showing how this is currently (not) embedded into the SBOMs
generated by the various SBOM generation plugins.

## Desired encoding

### CycloneDX

AFAIK there is no convention on how to express the difference
between 'regular' and shaded/embedded dependencies in CycloneDX.
Likely it would make sense to make use of the
[assembly](https://cyclonedx.org/use-cases/#assembly) concept
in CycloneDX?

### SPDX

In SPDX it looks like the `relationshipType` for shaded/embedded
artifacts should be `CONTAINS` instead of `DYNAMIC_LINK`.

## Use

When building a final SBOM for a project using this library, 'regular'
dependencies will be visible (and can have been overridden) to the
project, so the 'regular' dependencies from the SBOM from the library
can be ignored. However, the shaded dependencies are not visible in the
dependency tree, so they need to be taken from the published SBOM.
